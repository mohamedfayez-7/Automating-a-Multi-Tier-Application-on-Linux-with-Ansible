# Project: Automating a Multi-Tier Application on Linux with Ansible

## Objective
Using Ansible to fully automate the deployment, configuration, and orchestration of a multi-tier application (e.g., LAMP stack) across multiple CentOS VMs (master node, node1, and node2) in a VMware environment.

## Steps

### 1. Provisioning VMs
- Use Ansible to deploy and configure two nodes (node1 and node2) on VMware.
- Automate the installation of necessary dependencies like Apache on one node and MySQL on the other.

### 2. Role-based Deployment
- Use Ansible roles to separate the tasks:
  - **Web Server Role**: Configures node1 to host Apache/PHP.
  - **Database Server Role**: Configures node2 to host MySQL.
- Deploy a simple PHP application on the web server node and configure it to communicate with the database on node2.

### 3. Network Configuration & Load Balancing
- Automate firewall rules, IP tables, and networking configurations between the nodes.

### 4. Backup and Recovery Automation
- Automate backups of the database on node2 using Ansible scheduled jobs.
- Automate web content backup on node1.

### 5. Security
- Implement Ansible Vault to manage secrets such as database credentials.
- Use Ansible to apply security updates and harden the systems.

## Outcome
- A fully automated infrastructure with multiple VMs on VMware, deploying a multi-tier application.
- Centralized monitoring and logging for system health and performance.
- Secure and efficient infrastructure with automated backups and firewall configurations.

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with configuration management, automation, and managing complex multi-tier applications using Ansible.
